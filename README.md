# 🐍 Interactive Snake Game: A MATLAB App Designer Implementation
## Final Project for the Matlab and its Applications in Engineering Course

### Project Context
This project was developed as the **final evaluation** for the **Matlab and its Applications in Engineering** course. The design and implementation were conducted during an **Erasmus+ Academic Mobility at the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC) in Barcelona**, Spain. It demonstrates the practical application of graphical programming and event-driven logic within a technical engineering environment.

### Project Overview
The project focuses on the development of a modern, interactive version of the classic **Snake Game** using MATLAB’s graphical user interface (GUI) capabilities. The primary objective was to create a robust gaming application that integrates real-time user input, dynamic difficulty scaling, and a responsive interface. The study explored the efficiency of MATLAB in handling rapid state updates and collision detection within a matrix-based grid system.

### Key Technical Contributions
* **Event-Handling Framework:** Implementation of a real-time control system using `WindowKeyPressFcn` callbacks to manage snake navigation with zero-latency response.
* **Dynamic Difficulty Scaling:** Development of an algorithm that adjusts the game's execution speed (refresh rate) based on the current score, increasing the challenge as the snake grows.
* **Collision Detection Logic:** Engineering of a continuous monitoring system to detect head-to-wall and head-to-body impacts, managing game-over states and session resets.
* **Custom UI Ergonomics:** Design of a modern GUI featuring a toggleable **Dark Mode** to enhance visual comfort and adherence to Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) principles.

### Technologies & Frameworks
* **Environment:** MATLAB App Designer.
* **Core Concepts:** Event-Driven Programming, Object-Oriented GUI Design, and Real-time State Updates.
* **Focus Areas:** Matrix-based Grid Representation, Game State Management (Start/Pause/Stop), and Adaptive Timing Systems.
